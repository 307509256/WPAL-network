# Attribute Mask Network

By Ken Yu, under guidance of Dr. Zhang Zhang and Prof. Kaiqi Huang.

Attribute Mask Network is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structure designed for recognizing attributes from objects. Currently it is developed to recognize attributes from pedestrians only, using the Richly Annotated Pedestrian (RAP) dataset. It is not impossible to adapt this network to recognize attributes of other objects.

Some codes are written imitating Ross Girshick's [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn).
